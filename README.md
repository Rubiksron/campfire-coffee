There are files here for a public facing website that advertises Campfire Coffee and their products. There is a separate data page that includes a table which calculates future consumer needs, based upon the average number of customers per hour expected.  There are different fields to be filled out within said table, that includes all parameters required to trigger the object constructor. When the object constructor is activated it will instantiate an object, whose properties become the arguments that the user to passes through the available fields.  The calculations are done using JavaScript functions, that will dynamically populate the HTML page and append the instantiated child element to the parent table, thereby creating a new row on the table.
