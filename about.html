     <h1>This is where coffee tastes best.  Throughout the wilderness our slow roasted beans are brewed and enjoyed by deer-people, squirrel-people, and frogs.  The proof of quality is a wolf and mountain cat sitting peacefully across from a pot of our evergreen roast waiting to savor the delicate flavor profile.  The smokey notes of forest fire highlight an earthen finish that fades into gentle notes of moss on the palette.</h1>
